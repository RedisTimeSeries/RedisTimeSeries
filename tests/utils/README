create-cluster is a small script used to easily start a big number of Redis
instances configured to run in cluster mode.

The tool can also be used just to easily create a number of instances in a
Redis Cluster in order to experiment a bit with the system.

## USAGE
---

To create a cluster, follow these steps:

1. Edit create-cluster and change the start / end port, depending on the
number of instances you want to create.
2. Use "./create-cluster start" in order to run the instances.
3. Use "./create-cluster create" in order to execute redis-cli --cluster create, so that
an actual Redis cluster will be created. (If you're accessing your setup via a local container, ensure that the CLUSTER_HOST value is changed to your local IP)
4. Now you are ready to play with the cluster. AOF files and logs for each instances are created in the current directory.
5. Use "./create-cluster call <CMD...>" in order to Call a command (up to 7 arguments) on all nodes.

In order to stop a cluster:

1. Use "./create-cluster stop" to stop all the instances. After you stopped the instances you can use "./create-cluster start" to restart them if you change your mind.
2. Use "./create-cluster clean" to remove all the AOF / log files to restart with a clean environment.

Use the command "./create-cluster help" to get the full list of features.

----
### Varying the cluster topology

You can use the following env variables to change how the cluster is setup
- `CLUSTER_HOST`: change the announced host. Default: "127.0.0.1"
- `NODES`: change the number of main nodes in the cluster topology. Default: 3
- `PORT`: change the start port to incrementally associate to the nodes. Default: 30000
- `REPLICAS`: change the number of replicas per main node. Default 0
- `ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS`: Pass additional options to each redis-server start arguments. Default "". You can use "ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS=" --loadmodule redistimeseries.so " to load the module. 


### Example

#### Running RedisTimeSeries cluster with 15 main nodes and RedisGears

```
NODES=15 ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS=" --loadmodule ../../../RedisGears/bin/linux-x64-release/redisgears.so --loadmodule  ../../bin/redistimeseries.so " ./create-cluster start
NODES=15 ./create-cluster create
NODES=15 ./create-cluster call RG.REFRESHCLUSTER

# stop the servers
NODES=15 ./create-cluster stop
NODES=15 ./create-cluster clean
```
