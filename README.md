## Overview

RedisTimeSeries can hold multiple time series. Each time series is accessible via a single Redis key (similar to any other Redis data structure).

### What is a Redis time series?

A Redis time series comprises:

- **Raw samples**: each raw sample is a {time tag, value} pair.
  - Time tags are measured in milliseconds since January 1st, 1970, at 00:00:00.

    Time tags can be specified by the client or filled automatically by the server.

  - 64-bit floating-point values.

  The intervals between time tags can be constant or variable.

  Raw samples can be reported in-order or out-of-order.

  Duplication policy for samples with identical time tags can be set: block/first/last/min/max/sum.

- An optional configurable **retention period**.

  Raw samples older than the retention period (relative to the raw sample with the highest time tag) are discarded.

- **Series Metadata**: a set of name-value pairs (e.g., room = 3; sensorType = ‘xyz’).

  RedisTimeSeries supports cross-time-series commands. One can, for example, aggregate data over all sensors in the same room or all sensors of the same type.

- Zero or more **compactions**.

  Compactions are an economical way to retain historical data.

  Each compaction is defined by:
  - A timeframe. E.g., 10 minutes
  - An aggregator: min, max, sum, avg, …
  - An optional retention period. E.g., 10 year

  For example, the following compaction: {10 minutes; avg; 10 years} will store the average of the raw values measured in each 10-minutes time frame - for 10 years.

## Examples of time series
- Sensor data: e.g., temperatures or fan velocity for a server in a server farm
- Historical prices of a stock
- Number of vehicles passing through a given road (count per 1-minute timeframes)

## Features
- High volume inserts, low latency reads
- Query by start time and end-time
- Aggregated queries (Min, Max, Avg, Sum, Range, Count, First, Last, STD.P, STD.S, Var.P, Var.S, twa) for any time bucket
- Configurable maximum retention period
- Compactions - automatically updated aggregated timeseries
- Secondary index - each time series has labels (name-value pairs) which will allows to query by labels

## Using with other tools metrics tools
In the [RedisTimeSeries](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries) organization you can
find projects that help you integrate RedisTimeSeries with other tools, including:

1. [Prometheus](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-redistimeseries-adapter) - read/write adapter to use RedisTimeSeries as backend db.
2. [Grafana](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/grafana-redis-datasource) - using the [Redis Data Source](https://redis.com/blog/introducing-the-redis-data-source-plug-in-for-grafana/).
3. [Telegraf](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/telegraf)
4. StatsD, Graphite exports using graphite protocol.
