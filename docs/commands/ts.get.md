### TS.GET

Get the last sample.

```sql
TS.GET key [LATEST]
```

### Arguments

#### Mandatory arguments

* _key_ - Key name for time series

#### Optional arguments

* `LATEST` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.8)

  When the time series is a compaction: With `LATEST`, TS.GET will report the compacted value of the latest (possibly partial) bucket. Without `LATEST`, TS.GET will report the compacted value of the last 'closed' bucket. When the series is not a compaction: `LATEST` is ignored.
  
  The data in the latest bucket of a compaction is possibly partial. A bucket is 'closed' and compacted only upon arrival of a new sample that 'opens' a 'new latest' bucket. There are cases, however, when the compacted value of the latest (possibly partial) bucket is required instead of the compacted value of the last 'closed' bucket. `LATEST` can be used when this is required.

### Return Value

Array-reply, specifically:

The returned array will contain:
- The last sample timestamp, followed by the last sample value - when the time series contains data. 
- An empty array - when the time series is empty.

### Complexity

TS.GET complexity is O(1).

### Examples

#### Get Example on time series containing data

```sql
127.0.0.1:6379> TS.GET temperature:2:32
1) (integer) 1548149279
2) "23"
```

#### Get Example on empty time series 

```sql
127.0.0.1:6379> redis-cli TS.GET empty_ts
(empty array)
```
