Get all time series keys matching a filter list

[Examples](#examples)

## Required arguments

<details open>
<summary><code>filterExpr...</code></summary>

filters time series based on their labels and label values. Each filter expression has one of the following syntaxes:

  - `label!=` - the time series has a label named `label`
  - `label=value` - the time series has a label named `label` with a value equal to `value`
  - `label=(value1,value2,...)` - the time series has a label named `label` with a value equal to one of the values in the list
  - `label=` - the time series does not have a label named `label`
  - `label!=value` - the time series does not have a label named `label` with a value equal to `value`
  - `label!=(value1,value2,...)` - the time series does not have a label named `label` with a value equal to any of the values in the list

  <note><b>Notes:</b>
   - At least one filter expression with a syntax `label=value` or `label=(value1,value2,...)` is required.
   - Filter expressions are conjunctive. For example, the filter `type=temperature room=study` means that a time series is a temperature time series of a study room.
   - Whitespaces are unallowed in a filter expression except between quotes or double quotes in values - e.g., `x="y y"` or `x='(y y,z z)'`.

<note><b>Note:</b> The `QUERYINDEX` command cannot be part of a transaction when running on a Redis cluster.</note>

## Return value

Returns one of these replies:

- @array-reply where each element is a @bulk-string-reply: a time series key. The array is empty if no time series matches the filter.
- @error-reply (e.g., on invalid filter expression)

## Examples

<details open>
<summary><b>Find keys by location and sensor type</b></summary>

Create a set of sensors to measure temperature and humidity in your study and kitchen.

{{< highlight bash >}}
127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE telemetry:study:temperature LABELS room study type temperature
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE telemetry:study:humidity LABELS room study type humidity
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE telemetry:kitchen:temperature LABELS room kitchen type temperature
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE telemetry:kitchen:humidity LABELS room kitchen type humidity
OK
{{< / highlight >}}

Retrieve keys of all time series representing sensors located in the kitchen. 

{{< highlight bash >}}
127.0.0.1:6379> TS.QUERYINDEX room=kitchen
1) "telemetry:kitchen:humidity"
2) "telemetry:kitchen:temperature"
{{< / highlight >}}

To retrieve the keys of all time series representing sensors that measure temperature, use this query:

{{< highlight bash >}}
127.0.0.1:6379> TS.QUERYINDEX type=temperature
1) "telemetry:kitchen:temperature"
2) "telemetry:study:temperature"
{{< / highlight >}}
</details>
