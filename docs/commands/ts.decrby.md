Decrease the value of the sample with the maximum existing timestamp, or create a new sample with a value equal to the value of the sample with the maximum existing timestamp with a given decrement

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary> 

is key name for the time series.
</details>

<details open><summary><code>value</code></summary> 

is numeric data value of the sample (double)
</details>

<note><b>Notes</b>
- When specified key does not exist, a new time series is created.
- You can use this command as a counter or gauge that automatically gets history as a time series.
- Explicitly adding samples to a compacted time series (using `TS.ADD`, `TS.MADD`, `TS.INCRBY`, or `TS.DECRBY`) may result in inconsistencies between the raw and the compacted data. The compaction process may override such samples.
</note>

## Optional arguments

<details open><summary><code>TIMESTAMP timestamp</code></summary> 

is (integer) UNIX sample timestamp in milliseconds or `*` to set the timestamp according to the server clock.

`timestamp` must be equal to or higher than the maximum existing timestamp. When equal, the value of the sample with the maximum existing timestamp is decreased. If it is higher, a new sample with a timestamp set to `timestamp` is created, and its value is set to the value of the sample with the maximum existing timestamp minus `value`. 

If the time series is empty, the value is set to `value`.
  
When not specified, the timestamp is set according to the server clock.  
</details>

<details open><summary><code>RETENTION retentionPeriod</code></summmary> 

is maximum retention period, compared to the maximum existing timestamp, in milliseconds. Use it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `RETENTION` in `TS.CREATE`.
</details>

 
<details open><summary><code>UNCOMPRESSED</code></summary>

changes data storage from compressed (default) to uncompressed. Use it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `ENCODING` in `TS.CREATE`.
</details>

<details open><summary><code>CHUNK_SIZE size</code></summary> 

is memory size, in bytes, allocated for each data chunk. Use it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `CHUNK_SIZE` in `TS.CREATE`.
</details>

<details open><summary><code>LABELS [{label value}...]</code></summary> 

is set of label-value pairs that represent metadata labels of the key and serve as a secondary index. Use it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `LABELS` in `TS.CREATE`.
</details>

<note><b>Notes</b>

 - You can use this command to add data to a nonexisting time series in a single command.
  This is why `RETENTION`, `UNCOMPRESSED`,  `CHUNK_SIZE`, and `LABELS` are optional arguments.
 - When specified and the key doesn't exist, a new time series is created.
  Setting the `RETENTION` and `LABELS` introduces additional time complexity.
